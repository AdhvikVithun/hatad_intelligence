OWNERSHIP HISTORY (FULL CHAIN — STORY OF THE LAND):
Tamil sale deeds contain recitals ("இந்தச் சொத்து வரலாறு") that trace the property

- ownership_history[].document_date: Date of that transfer (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ownership_history[].remarks: Notable details (e.g. "Original patta holder", "Government grant")
Sort chronologically — OLDEST first. The LAST entry should be the current seller acquiring.
Do NOT include the current buyers as ownership_history entries.
Look for keywords: "கிரையம்" (sale), "வாரிசு" (inheritance), "பாகப்பிரிவினை" (partition), "தானம்" (gift)

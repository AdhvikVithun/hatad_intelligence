A Release Deed is a legal instrument by which one party releases or relinquishes their right, title, or interest in a property in favor of another party. In Tamil Nadu, release deeds commonly occur when a co-owner releases their share to another co-owner, or when a mortgagee releases the mortgage after repayment, or when a lienholder gives up their claim.

CRITICAL RULES:
- A release deed MUST be REGISTERED for immovable property claims.
- For MORTGAGE releases, the original mortgage document reference is critical — this should cross-reference with EC entries showing the original mortgage.
- CROSS-CHECK with EC: The EC should show the original encumbrance, and this release deed should correspond to clearing that encumbrance. If the EC still shows the encumbrance after the release deed date, flag it.
- For CO-OWNER releases: the releasing party should appear as a co-owner in the earlier title chain. If they don't, the release may be ineffective.
- For AGREEMENT releases: sometimes a buyer-seller agreement is released because the sale fell through. The release should reference the original agreement number.
- Check if ALL encumbrance holders have given release — if the property had multiple mortgages, releasing one doesn't clear the others.
- A release deed from a LEGAL HEIR requires the legal heir certificate to validate their standing.
- If the release is given by a family member, check if it was for adequate consideration — a release for no consideration between non-family members is suspicious.

Tamil terms:
- விடுதலை = release, அடமானம் = mortgage, பங்கு = share
- கடன் = loan, உரிமை = right/title

Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9. Convert to Arabic.

MORTGAGE AMOUNT VALIDATION (if this is a mortgage release):
- Extract original_loan_amount, outstanding_at_release, and repayment_confirmed.
- If the release states "full repayment" but the original_loan_amount and outstanding_at_release don't match logically (e.g., release says "full repayment of ₹50L" but original mortgage was ₹80L with no partial repayment history), add this discrepancy to _extraction_red_flags.
- If the release is for a partial amount, note the remaining balance.

PER-FIELD CONFIDENCE: In "_field_confidence", list any field where you are less than 90% confident in the extracted value. Use the field name as key and confidence (0.0-1.0) as value. Example: {"original_document.document_number": 0.6, "consideration_amount": 0.5}

EXTRACTION RED FLAGS: In "_extraction_red_flags", list ANY suspicious patterns, anomalies, or concerns you notice in the document. Examples:
- Release amount doesn't match original mortgage amount — numerical inconsistency
- Original mortgage document reference is missing or vague
- Release by non-family member for no consideration — suspicious
- Releasing party doesn't match the original mortgagee/lender
- Release issued years after repayment — delayed clearance risk
- Multiple mortgages on the same property but only one released
- Co-owner release without all co-owners' consent

A Gift Deed is a legal instrument by which a donor transfers property to a donee without monetary consideration (or for natural love and affection). In Tamil Nadu, gift deeds are commonly used for intra-family property transfers, especially from parents to children.

GIFT DETAILS:
- is_revocable: Whether the gift is stated as revocable or irrevocable (true = can be revoked)
- acceptance_clause: Whether the donee has formally accepted the gift (TRUE is required for validity)
- consideration_amount: Monetary consideration — should be 0 or "natural love and affection" for a genuine gift
- conditions: Any conditions imposed on the gift (e.g., donor retains life interest, donee cannot sell during donor's lifetime)
- reversion_clause: Whether the property reverts to donor if conditions are violated

STAMP DUTY:
- market_value: Guideline value or market value on which stamp duty was calculated
- stamp_duty_paid: Amount of stamp duty paid

WITNESSES:
- witnesses: List of witness names

CRITICAL RULES:
- A gift deed MUST be REGISTERED under Section 123 of Transfer of Property Act. An unregistered gift of immovable property is VOID.
- ACCEPTANCE by the donee is MANDATORY. Without acceptance clause, the gift is incomplete. Flag if missing.
- CONSIDERATION should be ZERO (or "natural love and affection"). If a monetary amount is listed, it may actually be a SALE disguised as a gift — flag this.
- A gift to an UNBORN person is VOID.
- A gift can be REVOCABLE if expressly stated, but once accepted and delivered, an irrevocable gift cannot be taken back.
- A gift to a MINOR is valid, but acceptance must be by the natural guardian or court-appointed guardian.
- Check for LIFE INTEREST reservation — "donor shall enjoy during lifetime, after donor's death property passes to donee" is a common pattern.
- CHECK stamp duty compliance — gift deeds between family members may have concessional stamp duty rates in Tamil Nadu (e.g., Re. 1 for gifts to spouse/children in some periods).
- If the donor creates an ONEROUS gift (gift with obligation/debt), the donee's acceptance extends to the obligation too.

Tamil terms:
- தானம் = gift, தான ஆவணம் = gift deed, அன்பும் பாசமும் = love and affection
- கொடையாளர் = donor, பெறுநர் = donee

Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9. Convert to Arabic.

PER-FIELD CONFIDENCE: In "_field_confidence", list any field where you are less than 90% confident in the extracted value. Use the field name as key and confidence (0.0-1.0) as value. Example: {"consideration_amount": 0.5, "donee.name": 0.7}

EXTRACTION RED FLAGS: In "_extraction_red_flags", list ANY suspicious patterns, anomalies, or concerns you notice in the document. Examples:
- Monetary consideration listed despite being called a "gift" — may be a disguised sale
- No acceptance clause found — gift may be legally incomplete
- Donee is a minor but no guardian acceptance recorded
- Gift marked as revocable — unusual for completed transfers
- Stamp duty paid on value much lower than market rate
- Donor retains life interest — property not fully transferred
- Gift to non-family member for no consideration — unusual, verify intent

TAMIL SCRIPT PRESERVATION RULE: If a field value appears in Tamil script (அகர வரிசை) in the source text, preserve it exactly as-is in UTF-8. Do NOT transliterate Tamil to Roman script. Do NOT replace Tamil characters with "?". Names, place names, and values that appear in Tamil script must be returned in Tamil script.

A Legal Heir Certificate (சட்ட வாரிசு சான்றிதழ்) is issued either by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) or by a civil court to establish who the legal heirs of a deceased person are. This is critical for property succession and title verification.

Extract the following information:

CERTIFICATE DETAILS:
- certificate_number: Certificate number or reference number
- issuing_authority: Who issued it — RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) with office name, or Court (name and location)
- court_or_revenue: Whether this is "revenue" (RDO-issued) or "court" (court succession certificate)
- date_of_issue: Date the certificate was issued
- case_number: If court-issued, the succession case number (e.g., O.P. No.)

DECEASED PERSON:
- deceased_name: Full name of the deceased person
- deceased_father_name: Father/Husband name of deceased
- deceased_address: Last known address
- date_of_death: Date of death
- place_of_death: Place of death if mentioned

LEGAL HEIRS — Extract ALL heirs:
For each heir provide:
- name: Full name of the heir
- relationship: Relationship to the deceased (son/daughter/wife/husband/mother/father/grandson/granddaughter etc.)
- age: Age if mentioned
- share_percentage: Share or portion if specified
- address: Address if mentioned
- minor: Whether the heir is a minor (true/false)
- guardian: Guardian name if the heir is a minor

PROPERTY REFERENCE:
- property_mentioned: Whether any specific property is mentioned in the certificate
- property_description: Description of property if mentioned

TAMIL RELATIONSHIP TERMS:
- மகன் = son, மகள் = daughter, மனைவி = wife, கணவன் = husband
- தாய் = mother, தந்தை = father, பேரன் = grandson, பேத்தி = granddaughter
- சகோதரன் = brother, சகோதரி = sister
- மாமா = uncle (maternal), அத்தை = aunt (paternal), சித்தப்பா = uncle (father's younger brother)

CRITICAL RULES:
- RDO certificates are simpler, typically list heirs without share allocation. Court succession certificates may specify exact shares.
- If a legal heir has predeceased the primary deceased person, their children may appear as heirs by right of representation — capture this.
- Look for exclusion clauses — sometimes a certificate specifically states certain persons are NOT heirs.
- If the certificate mentions "Class I heirs" or "Class II heirs" under Hindu Succession Act, note this classification.
- Muslim succession follows different rules (Shariat) — capture if the document references this.
- Christian succession follows Indian Succession Act — capture if referenced.

A Chitta is a revenue document issued by the Taluk Office that records the ownership and soil classification of land for a specific survey number. Unlike Patta (which is the landowner's copy), Chitta is the government's record. It shows the owner name, survey number, soil classification code, extent, and tax assessment. It is essentially the government counterpart of the Patta.

Extract the following information:

DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION:
- chitta_number: Chitta reference number if shown
- village: Village name (கிராமம்)
- taluk: Taluk name (வட்டம்)
- district: District name (மாவட்டம்)
- fasli_year: Fasli year of the record

OWNERSHIP:
- owner_name: Registered owner name (உரிமையாளர் பெயர்)
- father_name: Father's/Husband's name
- patta_number: Cross-referenced patta number

SURVEY DETAILS — Extract ALL survey entries:
For each survey number:
- survey_number: Survey number and subdivision (புல எண்)
- extent: Extent of land (பரப்பு)
- soil_code: Soil classification code (நில வகை). Common codes:
  - Code 1 (ஒன்றாம் வகை) = Wet irrigated (first class)
  - Code 2 (இரண்டாம் வகை) = Wet unirrigated (second class)
  - Code 3 (மூன்றாம் வகை) = Dry with well (third class)
  - Code 4 (நான்காம் வகை) = Dry rain-fed (fourth class)
  - மனை = House site
  - தோட்டம் = Garden
- soil_classification_details: Expanded description of soil type

FINANCIAL:
- tax_assessment: Land tax assessment amount (நிலவரி / புல வரி)
- cess: Any additional cess or levy

IRRIGATION:
- irrigation_source: Source of irrigation — கிணறு (well), கால்வாய் (canal), குளம் (tank), ஆறு (river), மழை (rain-fed)

LAND CLASSIFICATION:
- land_type: நன்செய் (wet/irrigated), புன்செய் (dry/rain-fed), தோட்டம் (garden), மனை (house site)
- is_poramboke: Whether the land is classified as போரம்போக்கு (government poramboke) — true/false

CRITICAL RULES:
- Chitta is the GOVERNMENT'S record, Patta is the OWNER'S record. They should MATCH. If they don't match, this is a serious red flag.
- SOIL CODE is important: it determines the land tax rate and what the land can be used for. A classification change (e.g., from agricultural to residential/மனை) requires a formal conversion process.
- If the Chitta shows போரம்போக்கு (poramboke), the land is GOVERNMENT PROPERTY and cannot be privately owned or sold. This is an absolute deal-breaker in due diligence.
- Types of poramboke: நத்தம் போரம்போக்கு (natham poramboke — habitation), வழி போரம்போக்கு (vazhi poramboke — road), ஆறு போரம்போக்கு (aaru poramboke — river), குளம் போரம்போக்கு (kulam poramboke — tank)
- The Chitta extent should match the Patta extent for the same survey number. Mismatch indicates measurement disputes.
- Check for INAM land references — Inam was a special tenure granted by rulers/zamindars, later abolished. Some conversion issues may persist.
- If multiple owners share a survey number, the Chitta shows one entry per co-owner with their respective share extent.

Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9. Convert to Arabic.

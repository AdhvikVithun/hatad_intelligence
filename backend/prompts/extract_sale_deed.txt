TAMIL SALE DEED STRUCTURE GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

A typical Tamil Nadu sale deed follows this structure:

PAGE 1 — STAMP PAPER:
  - Non-judicial stamp paper with denomination (Rs. 25000, etc.)
  - Stamp vendor details (e.g., "R. GOPINATH STAMP VENDOR")
  - Document reference on stamp (e.g., "No: 12896 / E / 2010 / 5 CBE")

PAGES 1-3 — SELLER & BUYER IDENTIFICATION:
  The deed text typically reads:
    "[Address] வசித்து வரும் [SELLER NAMES]... எழுதிக் கொடுத்த விவசாய பூமி கிரய சாசனம்"
    Translation: "The sale deed for agricultural land written and given by [SELLERS] residing at [ADDRESS]"
  
  Then later:
    "எழுதி வாங்குபவர் [BUYER NAMES]"
    Translation: "The one who writes and takes = BUYER"

  CRITICAL ROLE RULES:
  - Text BEFORE "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" or "வாங்குபவர்" → SELLERS (they "கொடுத்த" = gave)
  - Text AFTER "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" or "வாங்குபவர்" → BUYERS (they "வாங்கு" = take/buy)
  - "எழுதிக் கொடுப்பவர்" / "கொடுப்பவர்" = SELLER (giver)
  - "வசித்து வரும்" = "residing at" → what follows is a PERSON's address, NOT property location
  - "கதவு எண்" = door number → this is a residential address indicator

  CROSS-VALIDATION WITH PRE-PARSE HINTS:
  - If the pre-parse hints list "Seller Name Candidates" and "Buyer Name Candidates",
    your extracted seller[].name values MUST match the seller candidates, and your
    buyer[].name values MUST match the buyer candidates.
  - If your LLM extraction disagrees with the hint names, RE-CHECK the document
    structure. The hints are based on the position of "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" in the text
    and are HIGH CONFIDENCE. Do NOT swap sellers and buyers.

PAGES 3-5 — PROPERTY SCHEDULE (அட்டவணை / சொத்து விவரம்):
  - Survey number: க.ச. (கணக்கெடுப்பு சர்வே) or S.F.No. / T.S.No. / R.S.No.
  - கிராமம் = Village (PROPERTY location)
  - தாலூக்கா / வட்டம் = Taluk
  - மாவட்டம் = District
  - பரப்பு = Extent / Area
  - எல்லைகள் = Boundaries (North/South/East/West)

PAGES 5-10 — RECITALS & OWNERSHIP CHAIN (எப்படிச் சொத்து வந்தது / சொத்து வரலாறு):
  This section tells the STORY OF THE LAND — how the property passed through hands:
  - "இந்தச் சொத்து ... பத்திரம் எழுதிக் கொடுத்து" = Previous deed transfer
  - Each prior transfer mentions: previous owner, date, deed number, how they acquired it
  - May trace 2-3 generations of ownership (grandparent → parent → seller)
  - "கிரையம்" = purchased, "வாரிசு" / "உயில்" = inheritance, "பாகப்பிரிவினை" = partition, "தானம்" = gift
  - Often includes the original purchase price and SRO where old deed was registered
  
  ENCUMBRANCE DECLARATION:
  - "பாரமில்லை" / "எவ்விதமான பாரமும் இல்லை" = free from encumbrance
  - "இந்தச் சொத்து எவ்வித ஈடுகட்டு ... இல்லை" = no mortgage/lien
  
  PAYMENT & POSSESSION:
  - Payment mode: "காசோலை" (cheque), "வங்கி வரைவோலை" (DD), "NEFT", "RTGS", ரொக்கம் (cash)
  - "ஒப்படைப்பு" / "கைவசம்" / "possession" = when possession was given
  - "இன்றைய தேதியில் கைவசம் ஒப்படைத்தேன்" = possession given today

LATER PAGES — SIGNATURES:
  - "எழுதிக் கொடுப்பவர்" signatures = SELLERS signed here
  - "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" signatures = BUYERS signed here
  - "சாட்சிகள்" = Witnesses

LAST PAGES — REGISTRATION ENDORSEMENT:
  - Registration number (e.g., R/Vadavalli/Book1/5909/2012)
  - Registration date
  - SRO details

CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DOCUMENT NUMBER vs SURVEY NUMBER:
   - document_number = REGISTRATION number (format: R/SRO/Book/NNNN/YYYY or NNNN/YY)
   - survey_number = LAND survey number (format: 317, 317/1A) — appears after க.ச. or S.F.No.
   - These are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT numbers. Never put one in the other's field.

2. PROPERTY VILLAGE vs RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS:
   - property.village = the village where the LAND is located (near கிராமம் keyword, near survey numbers)
   - Seller/buyer addresses are their HOME addresses (with கதவு எண்/door number, வசித்து வரும்/residing at)
   - NEVER put a residential address in the village field

3. SELLER vs BUYER IDENTIFICATION:
   - The person(s) described BEFORE "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" are SELLERS
   - The person(s) described AFTER "எழுதி வாங்குபவர்" are BUYERS
   - At the bottom/signature section: "எழுதிக் கொடுப்பவர்" = SELLER signatures, "வாங்குபவர்" = BUYER signatures

4. REGISTRATION DATE:
   - The actual registration date is from the deed execution (usually in the body text or endorsement)
   - A "certified copy" date (if present) is when the COPY was issued — this is NOT the registration date
   - Look for patterns like "2012-ம் வருடம் டிசம்பர் மாதம் 13-ம் தேதி" (= 13 December 2012)

5. JOINT PARTIES (husband + wife / family members):
   - Tamil deeds commonly list related sellers/buyers together:
     "திரு. V. அருள்சிங் அவர்கள் மனைவி திருமதி. A. பொன்அரசி"
     This means A. பொன்அரசி is the ACTUAL party and V. அருள்சிங் is mentioned
     only for identification (as her husband).  Check the deed structure:
     * If both names appear BEFORE "எழுதிக் கொடுத்த" with separate PAN numbers,
       BOTH are sellers — list each as a separate entry.
     * If only ONE PAN number is given and the text says "அவர்கள் மனைவி"
       (his wife) or "அவர்கள் மகன்" (his son), the PAN holder is the main party.
       The relative may be a co-party only if explicitly enumerated (e.g., "-(2)").
     * Do NOT make the husband a seller/buyer just because he is referenced for
       identification.  "திரு. V. அருள்சிங் அவர்கள் மனைவி" preceding a buyer name
       means the WIFE is the buyer; the husband is merely her identifier.
   - "மனைவி" (wife), "மகன்" (son), "மகள்" (daughter) between two names = check whether
     BOTH are parties or only the second name is the actual party.
   - Each person with a PAN number MUST be a separate seller[] or buyer[] entry.
   - Pattern: "(2)" or "- (2)" after a name group indicates 2 sellers/buyers — count must match.
   - At the signature pages, count the number of distinct signatures/thumb impressions to verify
     you have extracted ALL parties.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
EXTRACTION FIELDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════

REGISTRATION DETAILS:
- document_number: Registration number (e.g., "R/Vadavalli/Book1/5909/2012")
- registration_date: Date of deed REGISTRATION at SRO (YYYY-MM-DD) — NOT certified copy date
- execution_date: Date of deed EXECUTION/signing (YYYY-MM-DD) — may differ from registration date
  Tamil pattern: "2012-ம் வருடம் டிசம்பர் மாதம் 13-ம் தேதி" = 2012-12-13
  This is the date the deed was physically signed, often in the body text opening paragraph.
- sro: Sub-Registrar Office name

SELLER DETAILS (எழுதிக் கொடுப்பவர் / விற்பனையாளர்):
- seller[].name: Seller name
- seller[].father_name: Father/husband name (S/o, D/o, W/o markers)
- seller[].age: Age if mentioned
- seller[].address: Residential address
- seller[].pan: PAN number if mentioned (format: ABCDE1234F)
  IMPORTANT: If the deed says "திரு. X அவர்கள் மனைவி திருமதி. Y (PAN NO. XXXXX)",
  then X and Y are BOTH sellers. Create a SEPARATE entry for each person.
  Count the total sellers — if the deed says "(2)" that means 2 sellers must be listed.

BUYER DETAILS (எழுதி வாங்குபவர் / வாங்குபவர்):
- buyer[].name: Buyer name
- buyer[].father_name: Father/husband name
- buyer[].age: Age if mentioned
- buyer[].address: Residential address
- buyer[].pan: PAN number if mentioned
  IMPORTANT: Same rule as sellers — each person with their own PAN is a SEPARATE buyer entry.
  If the deed says "(1)" or "- (1)" that means 1 buyer; verify your count matches.

PROPERTY DETAILS (from the property schedule / அட்டவணை):
- property.survey_number: Survey number(s) from க.ச. / S.F.No. — NOT the document number
- property.village: Village where the PROPERTY is located (கிராமம்)
- property.taluk: Taluk name (தாலூக்கா / வட்டம்)
- property.district: District name (மாவட்டம்)
- property.extent: Total area with units
- property.boundaries: North, South, East, West
- property.property_type: Agricultural/Residential/Commercial/Industrial/Mixed/Unknown

FINANCIAL DETAILS:
- financials.consideration_amount: Sale price in ₹ (integer, no commas)
  This is the TOTAL SALE PRICE. Look for:
    - Stamp paper header: "ரூபாய் 5,67,92,000/-க்கு கிரயம்" → consideration = 56792000
    - Body text: "விலை ரூ. X" or "கிரய தொகை ரூ. X"
    - Property schedule table: total amount column
  CRITICAL: If the pre-parse hints show a consideration_amount, USE that value.
  Strip commas and produce a plain integer (e.g., 5,67,92,000 → 56792000). NEVER return 0
  when a clear amount is visible on the stamp paper or in the deed text.
- financials.guideline_value: Government guideline value (0 if not mentioned)
- financials.stamp_duty: TOTAL stamp duty paid (integer, in ₹)
  IMPORTANT — many Tamil Nadu sale deeds are printed on MULTIPLE stamp papers.
  Each stamp sheet has its own serial number (e.g. "A 123456") and denomination (e.g. Rs. 25,000).
  If the deed spans N stamp sheets each worth ₹D, then stamp_duty = N × D.
  Example: 6 sheets × ₹25,000 = ₹1,50,000.
  If the pre-parse hints show "Stamp Sheets Detected" and "Total stamp duty", USE that value.
  Do NOT report just one sheet's denomination as the full stamp duty.
- financials.registration_fee: Registration fee (0 if not mentioned)

PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP (immediate previous owner — single object for backward compatibility):
- previous_ownership.document_number: Previous deed number
- previous_ownership.document_date: Previous deed date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- previous_ownership.previous_owner: Name of previous owner (before current seller)
- previous_ownership.acquisition_mode: Sale/Gift/Inheritance/Partition/Settlement/Unknown

OWNERSHIP HISTORY (FULL chain from the deed recitals — list all prior transfers):
  This is the STORY OF THE LAND. Extract every ownership link mentioned in the recitals.
  Tamil deeds often trace 2-3 generations. Extract each link as an object:
- ownership_history[].owner: The person who held the property at that stage
- ownership_history[].acquired_from: Who they got it from (previous holder)
- ownership_history[].acquisition_mode: Sale/Gift/Inheritance/Partition/Settlement/Unknown
- ownership_history[].document_number: The deed number for that transfer
- ownership_history[].document_date: Date of that transfer (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ownership_history[].remarks: Any notable details (e.g., "Original patta holder", "Government grant")
  Sort chronologically — OLDEST transfer first, most recent last.
  The LAST entry should be the seller acquiring the property (matching previous_ownership).
  IMPORTANT:
  - acquired_from MUST be filled for EVERY entry. Trace the chain carefully:
    If M. ஆறுமுகம் acquired via deed 89/1992 FROM M. மருதகுட்டி, then acquired_from = "M. மருதகுட்டி"
  - Do NOT include the current BUYERS as ownership_history entries — they are the destination.
    Example: If seller=N. Thulasiram and buyer=A. Ponnarasi, the LAST ownership_history
    entry should be "N. Thulasiram" acquiring the property (how the seller got it).
    Do NOT add an entry where owner=A. Ponnarasi acquired from N. Thulasiram — that is
    the CURRENT sale, not history.
  - Only include PAST ownership transfers that show how the property reached the current seller.
  - If a person is mentioned as "husband of buyer" (e.g. "V. அருள்சிங் அவர்கள் மனைவி A. பொன்அரசி"),
    the husband is NOT a party to the transaction unless explicitly listed as seller or buyer.
    Only the named buyer (A. பொன்அரசி) should appear in buyer[].  The husband reference is
    merely identification context.

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION (the verbatim property schedule / அட்டவணை text):
- property_description: Copy the complete property schedule section as-is from the deed.
  Include the exact Tamil/English text describing the property — survey number, village,
  boundaries, extent, classification. This is the legal description that matters for verification.
  If very long, provide the first 500 characters.

PAYMENT & POSSESSION:
- payment_mode: How the consideration was paid — "Cash" / "Cheque" / "Demand Draft" / "Bank Transfer (NEFT/RTGS)" / "Mixed" / ""
  Tamil: ரொக்கம் (cash), காசோலை (cheque), வங்கி வரைவோலை (DD), NEFT/RTGS
- possession_date: When physical possession was/will be given (YYYY-MM-DD or description like "on execution")
- encumbrance_declaration: The seller's declaration about encumbrances. Quote the key phrase:
  e.g., "Property declared free from all encumbrances, mortgages, charges, liens, and attachments"
  Tamil: "எவ்விதமான பாரமும் இல்லை"

WITNESSES:
- witnesses: List of witness names (from சாட்சிகள் section)
  Witnesses appear near the bottom of the deed, often after "இன்னொரெண்டு நிருபித்தவர்கள்" or "சாட்சிகள்".
  They may be HANDWRITTEN and partially illegible. Best practices:
  - Prefer the PRINTED version of witness names (often earlier in the deed) over handwritten signatures.
  - If a name is partially illegible, extract what you can and note "[partially illegible]".
  - Do NOT include garbled OCR character sequences as witness names.
  - Cross-reference: witness names sometimes appear in printed text with full details (S/o, address).

OTHER:
- special_conditions: Special conditions or restrictions
- power_of_attorney: POA details if applicable
- remarks: Any additional notes

TAMIL-SPECIFIC RULES:
- Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9. Convert to Arabic.
- Tamil units: எக்கர் (acre), சென்ட் (cent), ஹெக்டேர் (hectare), சதுர அடி (sq.ft). Transliterate.
- Multiple parties joined by "மற்றும்" / "and" / "," → list each as separate entry.
- Survey prefixes: Preserve S.F.No./T.S.No./R.S.No./O.S.No./N.S.No. exactly.
- Relation markers: S/o (மகன்), D/o (மகள்), W/o (மனைவி) — preserve as-is in father_name.

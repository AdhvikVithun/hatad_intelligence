TAMIL-SPECIFIC EXTRACTION RULES:
- Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9 ௰=10 ௱=100 ௲=1000. Convert to Arabic numerals in output.
- Tamil extent units: எக்கர் (acre), சென்ட் (cent), ஹெக்டேர் (hectare), ஆர் (are), குழி (kuzhi ≈ 144 sq.ft). Transliterate to English.
- Survey type prefixes: Preserve S.F.No. (புலம் எண்), T.S.No. (டவுன் சர்வே), R.S.No. (ரீ சர்வே), O.S.No. (பழைய சர்வே), N.S.No. (புதிய சர்வே). Do NOT strip it.
- Land classification Tamil terms: நன்செய் (nanjai/wet), புன்செய் (punjai/dry), தோட்டம் (garden), மனை (house site).
- Owner name markers: S/o (மகன்), D/o (மகள்), W/o (மனைவி) — preserve these.
- Multiple owners: List each owner as a separate entry in owner_names array.

CRITICAL — EXTENT PARSING:
- Tamil Patta tables have a serial number column (வ.எண் = row number like 1,2,3...) BEFORE the area column.
- The area column format is ALWAYS: "Hectares - Ares" (ஹெக்டேர் - ஏர்), e.g., "0 - 92.50" = 0 hectares 92.50 ares = 0.9250 hectares.
- DO NOT concatenate the serial number (வ.எண்) with the area. For example, if the row is "7 | 0 - 92.50", the serial number is 7 and the area is "0.9250 hectares" (0 hect, 92.50 ares), NOT "7.92.50 hectares".
- When you see a pattern like "X.YY.ZZ hectares" where X is a small integer, X is almost certainly the SERIAL NUMBER, not part of the extent. The real extent is 0.YYZZ hectares (YY ares, ZZ square meters).
- Convert the final extent to a clear format: "X.YYYY hectares" or "X acres Y cents".

CRITICAL — SOIL CLASSIFICATION CODES (மண் வகையும் ரகமும்):
- Patta tables have a separate column for soil type and classification codes (e.g., "4-3", "3-2").
- These codes are NOT part of the survey number. Do NOT concatenate them.
- Example: If the table shows Survey No="317" and Soil Code="4-3", the survey_no is "317", NOT "317, 4-3" or "317/4-3".
- These codes describe the soil quality/type and belong in the land_classification field, not survey_numbers.

CRITICAL — OWNER NAMES:
- In the format "Name1 மனைவி Name2", "மனைவி" means "wife". Name2 is the WIFE and Name1 is the HUSBAND. The owner is Name2 (wife), with father/husband_name = Name1.
- Example: "என்.துளசிராம் மனைவி சத்தயபாமா" → owner name = "சத்தயபாமா", father_name = "என்.துளசிராம்" (husband).

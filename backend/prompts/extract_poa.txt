A Power of Attorney (பவர் ஆஃப் அட்டர்னி) is a legal instrument by which a principal authorizes an agent to act on their behalf in property transactions, court proceedings, or other legal matters. In Tamil Nadu land due diligence, a POA must be carefully examined to determine if the person selling or transferring property has proper legal authority.

Extract the following information:

DOCUMENT DETAILS:
- document_number: Registration number / Document number
- registration_date: Date of registration
- sro: Sub-Registrar Office where registered
- book_number: Book number in registration records
- execution_date: Date the POA was executed (may differ from registration date)

PARTIES:
- principal: Full name of the person granting the power (also called "executant" or "donor of power")
- principal_father_name: Father's/Husband's name of principal
- principal_address: Address of principal
- agent: Full name of the person receiving the power (also called "attorney holder" or "agent")
- agent_father_name: Father's/Husband's name of agent
- agent_address: Address of agent

POA TYPE:
- is_general_or_specific: Whether this is a "general" power of attorney (broad authority) or "specific" / "special" power of attorney (limited to specific acts)
- is_irrevocable: Whether the POA is stated as irrevocable
- revocation_status: Current status — active / revoked / expired

POWERS GRANTED — Extract ALL powers:
- powers_granted: List of what the agent can do. Common powers include:
  - Sell, mortgage, lease, transfer property
  - Appear before Sub-Registrar and execute registration
  - Appear in courts on behalf of principal
  - Collect rent, manage property
  - Apply for building permission, layout approval
  - Deal with government offices, banks
  - Execute agreements, sign documents

PROPERTY DETAILS:
- property_description: Description of the property covered by this POA
- survey_numbers: Survey numbers mentioned
- village: Village name
- district: District name

EXPIRY / VALIDITY:
- validity_period: Duration of POA if specified
- expiry_date: Explicit expiry date if mentioned

WITNESSES:
- witnesses: Names of witnesses who attested the POA

CRITICAL RULES:
- A GENERAL POA (GPA) should be treated with extra caution in due diligence — GPA sales are NOT legally recognized by Supreme Court (Suraj Lamp Industries v. State of Haryana, 2012).
- An IRREVOCABLE POA coupled with interest (e.g., given as part of a sale agreement) has different legal standing than a simple revocable POA.
- Check if the POA was registered (Section 33 of Registration Act) — unregistered POAs cannot be used for immovable property transactions.
- If the principal is an NRI, check for consulate/embassy attestation.
- If the principal is deceased, the POA is automatically revoked — this is a critical flag.

Tamil numerals: ௧=1 ௨=2 ௩=3 ௪=4 ௫=5 ௬=6 ௭=7 ௮=8 ௯=9. Convert to Arabic.

PER-FIELD CONFIDENCE: In "_field_confidence", list any field where you are less than 90% confident in the extracted value. Use the field name as key and confidence (0.0-1.0) as value. Example: {"principal.name": 0.6, "validity_period": 0.5}

EXTRACTION RED FLAGS: In "_extraction_red_flags", list ANY suspicious patterns, anomalies, or concerns you notice in the document. Examples:
- General Power of Attorney (GPA) for property sale — SC ruling bars GPA sales (Suraj Lamp, 2012)
- POA is unregistered — cannot be used for immovable property transactions
- Irrevocable POA without coupled interest — legally questionable
- Principal appears to be an NRI but no consulate attestation found
- POA grants power to sell without specific property description
- Very broad powers granted with no expiry date
- Agent and principal appear to be unrelated parties — unusual for property POA
